PROJECT CharmQuark 

metrics:
render all ~9-10ms per loop
render changed: 0.07-0.1ms per loop
over 100 times faster to render changed!

add panorama motion to DB
add panorama motion to debugg
panorama animation next?

features:
Animate Tiles
Animate Panoramas
Animate actors

temp hack:
game_level loadBackground/loadForeground - harcoding panorama scrolling

debug:
right click a tile and be able to change its tilemap index?

general todo
Documentation Documentation Documentation
all size variables named including pixel or tile ("<var>_px" or "<var>_tile")
metrics: timeit to measure speed of render all vs render changed
	other metrics?
need to seperate out some of the parameters and name them, rather then lists and sublists (eg scroll speed)

buttomap
	the button map should reference the actual keys, which get mapped to specific behaviors

BUG:
default action trying to access depcrecated levelLayout Object

Need to decide if (height, width) or (width, height)
probably should do (height, width) since that is === to (rows, columns), but be consitent

should gameCamera just be in renderer?
	cleanup camera references

SOFTWARE DESIGN
use packages to organize modules?
Write down algorithm for rendering scenery somewhere!
In Panorama render: Var Names - need better names for each variable.  Can some of the calculations be optimized?  
Should the camera tile and offset be class fields for Renderer? 
sound logging/error checking is overboard, proably don't need now that things are working well.  
  (Assume the API is correctly used by the programmer, and trust to the unit tests?) 

RENDER
make renderLevel (render menu, cutscene, etc) their own methods.  Set the game.render method
on a load (removes a branch from render, cleans up code)

TESTING:
Render changed may have bugs not uncovered (like the overshoot/negative bug).  investigate
Put print statements in loops to ensure not rendering more than necessary panoramas or tiles
Experiment with smaller screen size, number of layers, etc. for speed/performance. 
Need to eventually figure out better unit testing

OPTIMIZATION
PRAMS all integers not strings
render changed background for animated panoramas (complex algorithm, may not be worth it)
from time time() method can be used to test certain modules for speed
	(NUMPY does not appear faster in basic list iteration)
can have pygame only get() relevant (chosen) events from the queue
Double Buffering?
For the EventHandler dictionary, use a tuple and index into it by int (not a dict with string) 
SPEED TESTS:
Passing a variable vs using the self. reference

ACTORS
Render an actor if onscreen only
Render all actors should include the actors and the scenery images to render.  These must be sorted on Y position to get proper layering when rendering
	will need to think of a good way to sort these optimally, or will impact performance

TOOLS
GIMP - learn mainly for transparency effect, then try to put in with transparency to pygame

ANIMATION
Panoramas
Tiles
Actors

HUD
Need a hud
Menus
Text Boxes (pygame tutorial has something on this)

EVENTS
on a load level event, need to flush the event queue to prefent incorrect events from running
create an event type EventList which adds a list of events to the queue
create an event type flush queue which removes any remaining events from the queue (fix the menu bug when transitioning)
how to change tiles based on events (e.g. pull a switch to open a door)
how to have events spaced out over frames, or timed?
-NPC's and objects which can be interacted with
-how to repeate an ambiant track?


PANORAMA
