PROJECT CharmQuark 
Can re-write render using pyopengl? - seems prudent.  Can learn open gl separately (in C++?) then work on porting to the game
	pygame can still be used for input processing etc

Graphics:
	need to inteligently laod assets: main char stuff loaded all the time, but load assets for levels particular 	to that area
	thread(s) to load assets?:  Seperate thread that runs in background loading assets as needed (approaching 	the start of a new area, new character loaded, new effects, etc)

update changed actors algorithm to re-render them if on a changed tile
Sprites for actors
Animate actors
	can probably put the AnimationState, and list of SpriteAnimations together under a wrapper class
		"SpriteAnimationsSuite"?
			SpriteAnimations[]			
			CurrentAnimation*
			AnimationState

Instead of re-render entire screen on a camera move, can we shift the entire screen and re-render the shifted off part?

minor optimizations: 
lists to tuples

minor cleanup:
move related functions next to each other (renderQ functs)
more calculations packaged as functions (eg screenBoundryLeft)
cleanup render all panorama with the CONSTANTS and methodCalls used in renderChanged
make some of the list values class fields for readability
	eg fg.scrolling[0] = fg.scolling_xmultiplier
Uml could use an update

fullscreen mode?
	get screen res, keep same ratio and create black border around rest?  Then only update to the actual playing 	area
	should also add ability to exit with escape key
	
features:
Sprites for actors
Animate actors
Weather or other visual ambient affects
Special effects (eg: add a spell cast animation, or any special animation call)
HUD
Text
Menu

debug:
right click a tile and be able to change its tilemap index?

general todo
Documentation Documentation Documentation
all size variables named including pixel or tile ("<var>_px" or "<var>_tile")
need to seperate out some of the parameters and name them, rather then lists and sublists (eg scroll speed)

buttomap
	the button map should reference the actual keys, which get mapped to specific behaviors

BUG:
default action trying to access depcrecated levelLayout Object

should gameCamera just be in renderer?
	cleanup camera references

SOFTWARE DESIGN
create a base animated class - things like fps,framesPerImage, update animated index, etc are common
use packages to organize modules?
Write down algorithm for rendering scenery somewhere!
In Panorama render: Var Names - need better names for each variable.  Can some of the calculations be optimized?  
Should the camera tile and offset be class fields for Renderer? 
sound logging/error checking is overboard, proably don't need now that things are working well.  
  (Assume the API is correctly used by the programmer, and trust to the unit tests?) 

RENDER
Tile animations for each tile instead of as a tilemap? - Might not be needed

TESTING:
Render changed may have bugs not uncovered (like the overshoot/negative bug).  investigate
Put print statements in loops to ensure not rendering more than necessary panoramas or tiles
Experiment with smaller screen size, number of layers, etc. for speed/performance. 
Need to eventually figure out better unit testing

OPTIMIZATION
use c types with numpy to create surfaces to blit?
PRAMS all integers not strings
can have pygame only get() relevant (chosen) events from the queue
For display.update, ifpassing recs, will not update entire screen (eg for render changed?) - seems to work fine
For the EventHandler dictionary, use a tuple and index into it by int (not a dict with string) 

ACTORS
Render an actor if onscreen only
Render all actors should include the actors and the scenery images to render.  These must be sorted on Y position to get proper layering when rendering
	will need to think of a good way to sort these optimally, or will impact performance
	

TOOLS
GIMP - learn mainly for transparency effect, then try to put in with transparency to pygame

HUD
Need a hud
Menus
Text Boxes (pygame tutorial has something on this)

EVENTS
on a load level event, need to flush the event queue to prefent incorrect events from running
create an event type EventList which adds a list of events to the queue
create an event type flush queue which removes any remaining events from the queue (fix the menu bug when transitioning)
how to change tiles based on events (e.g. pull a switch to open a door)
how to have events spaced out over frames, or timed?
-NPC's and objects which can be interacted with
-how to repeate an ambiant track?
