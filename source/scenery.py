# Image that can be used as layer of background or foreground.  Can be set to tile or scroll, and
# sections that are visible relative to the game level can be chosen
#
# @param path: directory of image
# @param image: filename of image
# @param imageSize: size in pixels of image [x,y]
# @param visibleSections: 2d array: each array is a box [left edge, right edge, top edge, bottom edge]
# @param scrolling: [[Xmultiplier, Xdivisor], [Xmultiplier, Xdivisor]]
# @param: alpha: does the image contain alpha information (e.g. invisiible pixels)
#
# Scroll speed can be calculated to perfectly scroll the level in the level editor, or user chosen. Formula to scroll the level is
#
# X direction:
# numerator: levelSize - displaywidth
# denomonator: imageSize - displaywidth
# numerator/denomonator = scroll speed in X direction to scroll the image over the entire level
#
# Y direction is same using Y params and displayheight
#
# NOTE if imageSize=displayWidth than set scroll speed to 0
#
# The above calculates the divisor.  Multiplier makes the image scroll faster then the level, so this must be user chosen.
# If user desires a 1.4 scroll speed, choose a multiplier of 14 and divisor of 10.

##DEV
# isMotion = True means the panorama scrolls in X/Y direction as screen stays still
# motionX_pxs - Pixels per second (positive/negative determines direction) in X direction
# movementY_pxs - Pixels per second (positive/negative determines direction) in Y direction

##DEV
# isAnimated = True means the panorama is animated
# animated_ips = number of images per second
# animated panorama filepath is to a directory of numbered pictures [0.<extension>, 1.<extension>, etc]
# engine will go through all images in order at designated fps (frames per second)
